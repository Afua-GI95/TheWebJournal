## American Vegetable Industry in the 1970's By Charles W. Porter. Report on Fresh and Processed Vegetable Productions, Supply and Demand. Per Capita.
"Unfortunately, these good times did not last. By the late 1970s commodity prices had dropped and the export market for grain had returned to normal as well. However, farmers will still produce high levels of crops and beginning to have difficulties covering production costs. In 1977 a group of farmers formed the American Agriculture Movement which organized a strike to draw attention to these issues. In December of 1977 farmers converged on state capitols across the country to demand parity, the income needed to pay for farm costs and make a living farming." - Charles W. Porter
